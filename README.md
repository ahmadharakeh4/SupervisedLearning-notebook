## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Heart Disease Classification
- **Description**: A classification model to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on features such as age, gender, cholesterol, and more.
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, LinearSVC, Hyperparameter Tuning.
- **Dataset**: [Heart Disease Data](./heart-disease/data/heart_disease.csv)
- **Results**: Highest achieved accuracy was 89.47% by Logistic Regression.

### 2. Car Sales Price Prediction
- **Description**: A regression model to estimate car prices based on vehicle characteristics such as mileage, age, and brand.
- **Techniques**: RandomForestRegressor, SVR, RidgeRegression.
- **Dataset**: [Car Sales Data](./car-sales/data/car_sales.csv)
- **Results**: Best R2 score was 0.25 by Ridge regression.
